            <h1 class='head1'>The Best Lemonade Since 2018!</h1>
            <p class='para1'>My wife and I have been on a mission for success with a very simple goal in mind: delicious and natural lemonade. It all started with our two lemon trees in the back yard. Making lemonade was something we frequently did for our own family as well as our neighbors. Through that process we received very positive feedback that gave us the idea to create our business; The Lemonade Stand. Our children, Audrie and Emastine, also played vital roles in the development of this as they would sell lemonade on the weekends. We put the two together and 3 years later here we are!</p>
            <h1 class='head2'>One Big Issue</h1>
            <p class='para2'>Shortly after our business began to grow, we ran into the problem of space. Not having enough space or production was holding us back from growing to where I know we could be. We decided to acquire land that allowed us to grow more of our lemons using the seeds from our own personal trees that started this endeavor. This blossomed into the current state of our business. Hiring family along the way to help with the process of higher demands and reaching out to our community to see what we could be doing better was the biggest key to our success. Before we knew it, we were our own certified family owned business.</p>
